# Sexy Server Menu
# for StarFall
Heya ! Here is my new project.
It is a StarFall script that gives access to a lot of functionnalities in an easy way with a GUI !
## How to use
1. Download SMM
  `autorun.txt` is the latest version (auto-updater)
  `major.minor.hotfix.txt` corresponds to a certain version
2. Put it inside `{Garry's Mod folder}\garrysmod\data\starfall`
  By default, your Garry's Mod is stored under `{steam\SteamApps\Common\GarrysMod}`
  `{Steam}` can either be where your Steam is installed (by default it is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`) or where your Stel Library is located.
3. Join a server with StarfallEx installed
4. Take the `StarFall - Processor` tool
5. Right-click to open the editor
6. Double-click on the downloaded file to open it
7. Close the editor
8. Left-click to place a processor
9. Shift+E (or sprint+interact) to select the components tool (or select the `StarFall - Components` tool)
10. Left-click next to the chip to create a screen
11. Link them by right-clicking on the screen, then on the chip
